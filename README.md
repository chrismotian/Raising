Unity mobile game with UAVs with an one touch button control, where you have to turn off the drones when they are in the middle of the screen. Because it is made for an alt ctrl game jam you control the game ideally with a way to hudge brick toy made not really working gun with a conductive crosshair... or just with your fingers.
